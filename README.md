In "The Choice is Yours" book series, you are the character!
These stories contain many different adventures you can go on
as you journey through strange and mysterious places and meet
interesting characters.

From time to time as you read along, you will be asked to make a choice …

![Instructions Pic 1](https://github.com/Tamsters24/The_Choice_Is_Yours/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable/instruction_pic1.jpg)

At the bottom of the chapter page, there will be icons matching
the choice that you will make. Tap the icon to proceed to the
next chapter.

The next chapter will appear as you proceed through your story,
and your choice may lead to success or disaster!

REMEMBER —
YOU CANNOT GO BACK!

The adventures you take are a result of your choices. You are
responsible because you choose! Think carefully before you make
a move! One mistake can be your last … or it may lead you to
wonders abound!

And that's it. Simple enough!

Because there are so many different paths that you might take depending on your choices as you
progress through your story, you can keep track of your progress and which chapters you've read!

![Instructions Pic 7](https://github.com/Tamsters24/The_Choice_Is_Yours/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable/instruction_pic7.jpg)

On the book cover page, select:

"CHECK YOUR STORY PROGRESS"

to bring up a map of what paths you have taken.

Chapters that you have not read yet are indicated by gray circles.
Once you have read them, the circle will change to green.

To keep track of your progress, you will need to register for an account.
Just type in your email address and password, and you're all set!
You will have to be logged in to keep track of your progress.

you can request an email to create a new password.

Now that you're ready to take the first step of your new adventure,
what happens next in the story? It all depends on the choices you make.
How does the story end? Only you can find out! And the best part is
that you can keep reading and rereading until you've had not one,
but many incredibly daring experiences!

THE CHOICE IS YOURS!
