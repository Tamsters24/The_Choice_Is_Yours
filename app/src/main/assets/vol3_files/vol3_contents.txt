Part.1a  You are visiting France with your two best friends, Peter and Sarah. For a lark, you all rent a balloon. Peter packs a picnic basket and Sarah buys a large jug of fresh milk. Harry, your dog, begs to come along and you let him scramble in. At last, you lift off and start your adventure. To the north, you can see the white-capped Alps and to the south, the blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea. As you drift over villages, people look up and wave at you. Suddenly, you notice storm clouds approaching from the north.
Choice.1a.2a You act now. Release gas from the balloon and land before the storm overtakes you.
Choice.1a.2b Perhaps the storm will pass quickly. Maybe you can ride it out. Do no act.
p1a  image vol3_files/vol3_picture1.jpg

Part.2a  You pull on the cord releasing some of the gas. allowing you to descend. Nothing happens! The storm clouds are coming closer, and the gentle wind has now turned into a howling gale. The coast is near. You must release some of the gas and settle to earth or you will be swept out to sea. Sarah says, "Let's pull harder. The valve is stuck."\nBut Peter pulls out his jackknife. The situation is desperate. You must make a large slit in the fabric. Both Peter and Sarah look frightened, and they are relying on you to make the right decision.
Choice.2a.3a Use Sarah's plan and pull together on the cord.
Choice.2a.3b Perhaps Peter is right. A slit in the balloon's fabric will let the gas out quickly.
p3a  image vol3_files/vol3_picture2a.jpg

Part.2b  Lightning flashes and the four of you are treated to a frightening and spectacular display of nature's fury. As the night passes, the storm breaks and the moon appears from behind clouds. The night wind is warm, and far below, you see the silvered waters of the Mediterranean. Dawn comes with streaks of red and gold, and to the south, you see a hazy line of yellow, the coast of North Africa and the Sahara desert beyond!\nShould you try to land the balloon near the shore where fishermen could help you, or should you drift further south toward the desert? There will be cities of white with minarets, cool oases with date palms and Arabs in flowing white robes. You take a vote.
Choice.2b.3c You all decide to land near the shore. Release the balloon's gas and descend.
Choice.2b.3d The lure of the Sahara is too strong to stop your flight. Put on some suntan lotion and drift south.

Part.3a  You all pull together. Even Harry is able to tug on the end of the cord. You hear the slow hiss of escaping gas. But without warning, the cord breaks. Cold wind and rain are soaking you and lightning flashes. You attempt to slit the fabric with Peter's knife. The knife slips from your chilled fingers. The balloon is lower now, sweeping over a village. A church spire looms closer and closer. You brush past it, startling pigeons perching on the gutters of the roof. Beyond the village you see a sandy beach, anchored fishing boats and the sea beyond. You must do something!\nSarah suggests that you toss out the anchor with its long rope. Perhaps you can snag something.\nThe danger is that a quick stop might rip the basket apart!
Choice.3a.4a Decide to drop the anchor.
Choice.3a.4b Decide to do nothing and hope that the local fishermen will come to your rescue when the balloon settles into the water.

Part.3b  You take Peter's knife and climb up on his shoulders. The balloon is swinging wildly in the winds of the storm. Reaching as far as you can, you puncture the silk of the balloon. Gas starts to escape in a rush. You look down from Peter's shoulders just in time to see the waves reach up and grab the balloon's wicker basket. Harry howls in terror. As the wicker basket lands in a cloud of spray, you are thrown clear. You sink into the churning sea for what seems like minutes and then slowly rise to the surface. The balloon is nowhere in sight, hidden by the moving mountains of water. You strike out in what you hope is the right direction.
TO PART 4c
p3a  image vol3_files/vol3_picture3b.jpg

Part.3c  Looking up and down the shoreline you realize that you have landed on a very remote section of the North African coast. Nothing except sand and low, scrubby hills can be seen in either direction. But it certainly feels good to be back on solid ground again. Eagerly, you all start to explore your surroundings. Hary finds an interesting bush, but it is Peter who spies the entrance to a cave which overlooks the beach. Just as you start to climb toward the cave, a dozen horsemen in white robes thunder over the top of a sand dune and ride toward you, shouting and waving swords.
Choice.3c.4d Accept capture, raise your hands in surrender, put on a good smile and hope for the best.
Choice.3c.4e You think the horsemen are dangerous, so hide in the cave that Peter has discovered. Watch your head as you crawl through the narrow entrance to the mysterious cave!
p3c  image vol3_files/vol3_picture3c.jpg

Part.3d  The endless, golden sands of the Sahara drift beneath you. After the cold night, the hot sun feels good. You see caravans with hundreds of camels, sheltered oases and mud-walled villages. Sarah gives a shout of surprise, for there to the south is a great mound of silver. As you drift closer, you see that it is a domed, metal machine with hundreds of portholes set along its rim.\nShould you descend and land? This must be a flying saucer, and perhaps you will be the first to meet space travelers. But Peter cautions you to drift on. Travelers from outer space may be dangerous.
Choice.3d.4f Decide to land, pull the cord and descend.
Choice.3d.4g Decide to play it safe, hope that the Space travelers won't see you, and drift on.

Part.4a  You and Peter heave the anchor over the side. The rope snakes out rapidly. Far below you, the anchor bounces off a cobblestone street and through a flower bed, and drags across the sandy beach. It is too late for the anchor to catch on anything! Just as you lose hope, the anchor, which is now dragging through the water, catches on a small boat. There is a violent shock as the balloon whips the end of the anchor line taut. For a second the balloon strains on the end of the rope like a dog on a leash. But seconds later you see the boat has broken loose and is being towed behind the balloon. At least you will have something to shelter in when the balloon finally settles into the raging sea. But should you slide down the rope to the deck of the boat now, or wait for morning?
Choice.4a.5a Slide down the rope now.
Choice.4a.5b Wait for the storm to abate and for morning to come.
p4a  image vol3_files/vol3_picture4a.jpg

Part.4b  The storm has swallowed up the light and it is getting dark. The balloon is slowly descending toward the angry sea. You catch a last glimpse of the shoreline. It seems only a mile or so away. And then you crash down into the sea. There is a tumbling of bodies. The wicker basket of the balloon is partially filled with water but still floating. Peter and Sarah cling to each other with fright and cold. Should you swim for shore to direct the rescue effort by the fishermen, or should you stay with your friends? They look to you for a decision.
Choice.4b.5c Perhaps you should swim for shore. You have always been a strong swimmer.
Choice.4b.5d Maybe you should stay with your friends and await rescue.

Part.4c  At first your strokes are strong and sure. But you have never swum in mountainous seas like this. From the top of a wave, you catch sight of the shore, but then a wave, larger than rest, breaks over you, filling your mouth and nose with sea water. You panic. You'll never make it, swimming against the seas and wind!
TO PART 5e

Part.4d  The dozen horsemen reign up next to you in a shower of sand. The men are dark and fierce- looking, with brilliant white teeth and deep-set eyes. In a strange language, they command you to get on a horse. With Harry trotting proudly beside you, the riders tum back into the desert. For hours, there is only the sound of leather creaking and the hollow echo of hooves on barren rock and sand. They follow a path through a narrow canyon, guarded by desert tribesmen who stand high above on rock ledges, holding rifles and watching the horizon. You have entered their desert stronghold!\n The valley opens out and soon you see parched fields of wheat and large, open ponds of water. Finally, you enter a white city, surrounded by high mud walls.\n You are taken to a large house. As you enter, you see that it is a palace with an open courtyard in the center, green plants growing everywhere and colorful birds singing from nearly every branch. Friendly servants come and bring you food and drink. But every door is guarded by one of the desert tribesmen.
TO PART 5f

Part.4e  As you all lie panting in the cave from your hard run, you hear the horsemen thunder by. "They didn't see us after all!" Peter exclaims. Cautiously, you peer out the opening. The horsemen continue on for a moment and then circle back. It looks like they did see you at first, and then lost sight of you as you scrambled for the cave.\n"They'll start to search for us soon," Sarah says. "What will we do?"\nYou can see their bright swords in the sunlight. Their leader, dressed in purple robes, wheels his horse around and points directly at your cave. Other horsemen start to dismount and climb the hill toward you.\n"Look," Peter shouts. "There are old doors here in the cave." You examine the doors. There are three of them and each is painted a different color. Perhaps they are storage vaults for smugglers, or even the entrance to tunnels. You had better choose one of them and hide.
Choice.4e.5g Open the Blue Door and enter it quickly.
Choice.4e.5h Peter thinks the Red Door is best. Enter the Red Door and lock it behind you.
Choice.4e.5i Sarah and Harry pick the White Door. What a difficult decision, but this is your choice. Be quick about it!

Part.4f  Lower and lower you drift. Finally, you settle to earth and the spacemen surround you. You see that although their ears are nearly as large as their hands and flap excitedly, their faces are smiling. They all point to Harry and you realize that they think Harry is your leader, because of his big ears. One man with very large ears motions Harry to follow him. And all of you follow Harry, wishing that your ears were big and floppy.\nThe man leads you to a silver dome and, after bowing low to Harry who calmly wags his tail, directs you to enter. And as you stand there expectantly, a red mist hisses from hidden pipes, and you fall to the floor, asleep.
TO PART 5j
p4f  image vol3_files/vol3_picture4f.jpg

Part.4g  For a minute, you think you are safe. The balloon makes no sound and you are nearly past the flying saucer's landing place. But the shadow of the balloon drifts across the saucer and you see men looking up. A white light flares and before you can do anything, a hole burns in the balloon's fabric. Down you go to a hard landing. Soon, you are surrounded by men in blue spacesuits. They are smaller than you and very strong. Several of them shout, "Gleeb Fogo, Gleeb Fogo!" They shove you into a metal hut and the door slams behind you. Harry starts to burrow excitedly in the dirt floor, and you realize that he is trying to dig an escape tunnel. Perhaps it is better to wait to see what your captors want of you. Possibly, they come in peace.
Choice.4g.5k Follow Harry down his tunnel, give him a hand and crawl.
Choice.4g.5l Wait to see what happens when your captors come to question you, and be patient.

Part.5a
Peter and Sarah first slide down the rope. Harry
climbs on your shoulders and vou work your way
down to the deck of the small sailing craft. Peter
checks below deck and then reports (with a
snappy salute) that there is no one aboard, and
that there is plenty of food and water on board.\n
The first order you give is to cut away the balloon.
It is pulling the boat too fast and spray is
sizzling over the desk.\n
Sarah thinks that you should turn the boat
around, raise the sails and beat back against the
wind to the coast of France.\n
But Peter is keen to go on. To the south, he
says, is the golden coast of Africa, with desert
sheiks, caravans and all sorts of adventure.

Choice.5a.6b .
p5a  image vol3_files/vol3_picture5a.jpg

Part.5b  A long night passes. The storm slowly abates. The black clouds part to reveal a sky full of stars and a slipper moon. Trailing far behind and below you, is the small boat, its wake silver in the moonlight. Toward dawn, you and your friends fall asleep. You awake to shouting. As you peer over the rim of the basket, you see a ma with a full black beard on the deck of the boat shaking his fist at you. He takes the line which is caught in his boat's rigging and wraps it around a winch. Slowly, he reels you in, as if you were a giant puffer fish. Harry growls deep in his throat, as though he senses danger.
Choice.5b.6-
Accept capture. After all, it is your fault that the man's boat has been torn loose from its anchor. Perhaps he will accept your apology and offer you food and drink.
Choice.5b.6- . Sarah is more cautious. She points out that the man is dangerous-looking and very angry. Wouldn't it be safer, she says, if we were to cut loose and let the balloon sail on? Land can't be far away, and all of you feel more confident, now that the storm is gone and the sun is rising.

Part.5e  But then you remember that if you lay on your back with your lungs full of air and arms and legs outstretched, you'll float like a cork. You try this and find it much easier. The sky whirls around as you are tossed from wave to wave. It seems like a very long time but finally, you hear your dog, Harry, barking excitedly. You lift your head and there, only a few waves away, is the balloon. With thanks in your heart, you swim the last few strokes and your friends pull you aboard. Harry, who saved you, licks your face. You rest, huddled together, waiting for the dawn.
TO PART 6-
p3c  image vol3_files/vol3_picture5e.jpg

Part.5f  At last, a man enters, dressed in red robes with a silver-headed dagger on one side and a sword slung from the other.\n"Greetings, honored guests," he says in a deep voice. "It is the fate of Allah that you have come to my kingdom. Perhaps it is also fate that you hold the key to my victory against hateful men who have invaded my desert kingdom.\n"Will you join me in my fight against these evil people, or must I return you to the shore of the Mediterranean? The choice is yours, and I will do you no harm if you do not accept."
Choice.5f.6- Join the chieftain.
Choice.5f.6- You feel that this sounds too risky, and tell the desert chieftain that you wish to return to the North African coast.

Part.6v  Much as you would like to see the inside of the alien ship, you have no desire to be whisked off into space. You step back to what you hope is a safe distance and watch what happens. In a moment the portal closes, and almost instantly the ship rises, silently, straight up. Within a few minutes it is lost from view. You walk over to look more closely at the primitive looking people sleeping on the pallet. They begin to stir and stretch and rub their eyes as if waking from a long sleep.
Choice.6v.7m Stay and try to make friends with the primitive people.
Choice.6v.7n Return to the hill and try to find your way back to the Cave of Time.

Part.7a  Slowly you unsheath your knife and then run for the entrance. The wolf is after you like a shot. It leaps and tears your bearskin coat. While the wolf is regaining its balance, you run into the cave and toward the left tunnel. The wolf runs after you. You look over your shoulder and lose your footing. Instead of falling on the ground, you feel yourself sliding down a long, steep chute. Far above, the wolf howls with frustration. You land in a heap at the bottom of a pit--shaken but unharmed. There is a dark passageway to the left. You toss in a stone and, after what seems like a long time, you hear a splash far below. Fortunately, there is another passageway to the right, which is dimly lit by phosphorescent light.
TO PART 4i
p7a  image vol3_files/vol3_picture7a.jpg

Part.7b  Holding your knife with its long ivory blade pointing upward, you advance very slowly, step by step, toward the wolf, which stands growling softly, apparently confused by your boldness.\nThen it springs. You lunge with your knife, twisting your body to avoid its awesome fangs. Your knife cuts through nothing but air, but the wolf succeeds only in tearing off your bearskin coat. It stops for an instant to sniff at the coat, and you tum and plunge your knife into its neck. The wolf twists, looks at you with hate in its eyes, and falls limp, its spinal cord severed.\nNow you are a true Stone Age hunter. You skin the wolf and walk into the cave. You follow the right-hand tunnel, thinking you may find your way back to your own time, but suddenly you feel yourself falling--faster and faster into what seems a bottomless pit.
TO PART 8a

Part.7c  You climb up the steps between the last car and the caboose just as the train begins to start up again. When you open the door to the car, you are surprised to see soldiers in blue uniforms holding old-fashioned rifles. They advance upon you. One of them strides past you to see if anyone else followed you.\n"How did you know this was the President's car?" the first soldier asks you.\n"What President?" you reply.\nThen, to your amazement, you get the answer to your question, for the very tall bearded man walking down the aisle could be no one else but Abraham Lincoln.\n"That's all right," the President tells the soldiers, "l could use some company right now. You may stay until we reach Gettysburg," he says to you. "But maybe you should get off at Parkersville. I know of some good people there who will help you out."
Choice.7c.8b Stay on until Gettysburg.
Choice.7c.8c Get off at Parkersville.
p7c  image vol3_files/vol3_picture7c.jpg

Part.7d  If you take the train, it may ruin your chance to return to the Cave of Time. It seems best to stay close to the tunnel. At any rate, you decide you will be able to think better after getting something to eat, so you walk over to the farmhouse.\nThe farmer's wife gives you a bowl of soup, but she won't believe the story you make up to explain your presence there. You soon get the idea you are not welcome, so you trudge on into town, where the innkeeper lets you have a room for the night.\nThe next morning you get a ride on a coach to Philadelphia. A Quaker family takes you in and helps you get work as a carpenter's apprentice. You don't like the job, and soon you leave Philadelphia to go to New York, where you are able to find a job working for a newspaper. Eventually you travel all over the world. You live a long and wonderful life, dying just a few years before you are born.
THE END
p7d  image vol3_files/vol3_picture7d.jpg

Part.7e  With considerable trepidation you slide down the tunnel. You mean to turn off at one of the side passageways that might take you back to your own time, but you are too exhausted to search for the entrance. You half slide, half climb down the tunnel--further back into time--then you lose your balance. You fall a great distance, land in deep water, and sink a long ways.\nYou are barely able to surface and, when you do, you find that the air is filled with dense fog. The water is warm, but the fog is so thick you can hardly breathe. The air smells slightly of sulphur. Gasping for breath, you realize you must be several billion years in the past and that oxygen has not yet been released into the atmosphere.
THE END

Part.7f  Through computer instruction you are able to learn The language, which you find is similar to English, so you are soon able to communicate with your hosts.\nThey are not at all surprised to hear that you arrived through the Cave of Time.\n"You are not the first," the head of the house-hold tells you. "but we have visitors from other times only once in a great while. When someone comes, we are always glad to learn about life in another era, because here we have achieved a sort of paradise--we do not work, and the world is at peace. It is a perfect society. That is why primitive epochs, such as yours, interest us so much.
Choice.7f.8d Stay in "the perfect society".
Choice.7f.8e Try to return to the Cave of Time.

Part.7g  You take a deep breath, dive down, and swim through the tunnel. There is light ahead. In a moment you surface in a beautiful lagoon. Thatched cottages are nestled among the palm trees that rim the white sand beach. A warm, soft breeze brings the scent of jasmine and the sound of strange melodies from sonorous drums. Looking out to the inlet from the sea, you can see a fleet of outrigger skiffs with multi-colored sails running into the lagoons before the wind, their owners leaning against the booms to hold the sails out.\nYou walk toward the village. Several handsome, brown-skinned people see you. Some of them run away, but others walk toward you with hands held up in salute. Two children, holding garlands of flowers, run up to you. Someone calls--"Aloha!"\nSoon you are sitting in front of a huge beach fire, cooking crabs and eating buana cake. Having never had a visitor before, your hosts are happy to see you. They welcome you into their society. Gradually you learn their language. The boys tell you they are your brothers; the girls that they are your sisters.\nYou enjoy life in this new paradise, but you still wonder whether there might be a way to get back to the Cave of Time. Your new friends are unable to help. Perhaps if you journeyed inland you could find some who could. Your friends warn you against trying, however. They tell you that you will find only terrible jungles and rivers filled with crocodiles.
Choice.7f.8f Remain with your new friends.
Choice.7f.8g Journey inland.
p7g  image vol3_files/vol3_picture7g.jpg

Part.7h  Swimming through the underwater tunnel may be the only way to get out of the grotto, but the risk of drowning seems too great. You explore the rocks in the grotto and think about how you might possibly get up through the roof.\nSuddenly a voice calls, "Hello." You whirl around and notice for the first time, huddled in the corner, a woman with sparkling blue eyes and a mysterious smile. She is sitting crosslegged, propped against a rock which is shaped in a way that gives her a comfortable seat. In her hands she is holding a flute, and as you stare in amazement she plays an unfamiliar melody with a sweetness and purity of tone such as you have never heard.\n"Hello," you reply. "Tell me--who are you and how can we get out of here?"\n"Sit down," she says, "and relax. You have all the time in the world."\n"What do you mean?" you reply. "I am trapped. I slid down from the Cave of Time and I want to get out."\n"Believe me," the woman says, "there's no way to get out; but do not be concerned. It is a beautiful place and you can be very happy here."\n"But we'll starve. How long have you been here?" you exclaim.\n"Forever and not at all," she replies, "for this is the part of the cave which leads neither to the past nor to the future. Here, time does not exist, so, of course, you will never be hungry or bored, and, although you can never get out, you will be here for no time at all."
TO PART 8h

Part.7i  You walk on and on, hoping the passageway will lead you to your own time. You soon come to a tunnel that leads into a dark, musty room resembling the cellar of a large house. There are a great many people huddled in groups, sitting on blankets in complete darkness save for the light of a few flickering candles. You hear the dismal wail of a siren. Near the center of the room an old-fashioned radio sits on the table playing a mixture of classical music and static. Then the sirens stop, the ground shakes, and you hear a tremendous explosion nearby, then another further away, then another so close that a wall and half the ceiling c.ome crashing down in a pile of rubble, blocking the tunnel. You and the others scramble to the opposite side of the room, coughing and gasping in the dust-filled air.\nYou are about to begin a new life. The year is l94O; the place, London.
THE END
p7i  image vol3_files/vol3_picture7i.jpg

Part.7j  You walk back through the cavern, wondering if the entrance will still be blocked by ice. This time, though, you are greeted by a warm breeze. Sunlight is shining on the ground near the entrance, and you walk outside.\nSquinting your eyes in the bright light, you see a world totally different from the one you know. You are on a hillside. For miles and miles you can see grassy plains speckled with lakes. Nearby is a forest of towering ferns, swaying in the wind. The world before you seems strangely quiet, except for the faint rumbling of distant thunder. Suddenly, the thunder seems much closer--and louder. The thundering sound is moving through the ferns. You run up the hill looking for a place to hide. A huge shadow passes on the ground. Above you, soaring through the air, is a creature larger than any bird you have seen.\nNow it is clear what has been happening. The cave is a crack in the universe--a place outside space-time. Once inside its tunnels you could find yourself at any place, at any time. If you enter again you might be sent to a place from which you could never escape. Yet that is your only hope of returning to your own place and time.
Choice.7h.8i Go back into the cave.
Choice.7h.8j Remain outside.

Part.7k  You jump far out and fall faster and faster. You enter the water feet first and hit bottom, but the soft mud receives you gently. In a few seconds you reach the surface. You swim to the outer banks of the moat shaken but unharmed. You scramble up the bank and run for the cover of the forest.\nYou walk along the edge of the forest until well out of sight of the castle, then head across the open countryside. You stop a peasant to ask him where you might stay for the night.\n"Walk up that hill and you'll see before you the waters of Loch Ness," he says. "You'll find a place there."\nYou follow his directions and, seeing some little houses near the lake, proceed toward them. Darkness is setting in, and you are glad when you meet a fisherman who says he will give you shelter for the night. He and his wife are kindly people; they invite you to stay and earn your keep by helping them fish.
Choice.7i.8k Accept their offer.
Choice.7i.8l Decide to travel on.

Part.7l  You decide to wait, but soon regret it. A guard visits you twice a day and brings you only black bread and water. In a few days you feel almost too weak to escape even if you have the chance.\nBut just as you are beginning to despair of ever regaining your freedom, the guard walks in, smiling.\n"The King has ordered you out of here," he says. "We have a much more important prisoner--a man who insulted the King's horse." He laughs in your face. You don't know whether he is telling the truth or not, but he holds the door and waves you out. You walk down the long flight of stone steps to the main courtyard, free again--at least for the moment. The drawbridge is down and there seems to be nothing in the way of your leaving the castle.\nThere is a splendid black horse tied up near you, probably owned by one of the knights. It occurs to you that you could cover a lot of ground on that horse before anyone realizes what happened.
Choice.7i.8m Mount the horse and ride off.
Choice.7i.8n Ask the King for refuge.

Part.7m  The people look around curiously. They hardly seem to notice your presence. One by one they get up and walk around. One of them drinks from the stream. They make grunting and clicking noises, but do not seem to be actually talking among themselves. The largest of the group picks up a stick from the ground and begins prying up the roots of plants along the edge of the stream. He bites at each one..Finally he smiles and passes the root around to the others. One woman claps her hands. The others begin to find sticks. One of the men hands you a piece of root. You bite at it. It tastes like a dirty carrot. The women smile at you. You are accepted in the group.\nThe next morning you wake up in the soft mossy bank in Snake Cavern, a few dozen yards from the entrance to the cave, wondering how much of what has been happening to you has been a dream and how much has been reality. But you have no desire to go into the Cave of Time again.
THE END

Part.7n  You run up the hill and out of sight before any of the primitive people awaken. You must find an entrance to the Cave of Time. You search in the high rocky ground for some opening. Hours go by; dusk is fast approaching. Just as you are about to give up hope, you spy the entrance to a cave under a rock ledge. You eagerly step inside and have only a moment's awareness that it is the den of a saber-toothed tiger.
THE END
p7n  image vol3_files/vol3_picture7n.jpg

Part.8a  You feel yourself slowly regaining consciousness. You are in your bed at Red Creek Ranch, looking up at Uncle Howard. Standing nearby is a friend of his who is a doctor.\n"You took quite a bad fall climbing on those rocks up in the canyon," Uncle Howard says. "Doc Parsons tells me he doesn't know why you didn't break any bones. We were real worried about you--thought you got lost in one of those caves up there."\nYou feel a bit dizzy and weak, so you just smile and say nothing. Probably no one would believe you anyway. Years later, though, you write a book about your adventures in the Cave of Time.
THE END

Part.8b  "l'd like to stay on till Gettysburg," you say.\n"Well, that's fine," the President replies. "Why don't you sit across from me? I have to write out a little talk I'm giving there, and, while I'm doing that, you think about what you're going to make of your life, because you can't spend all your time riding on trains, after all."\nYou nod in agreement and sit quietly watching the President scribbling some lines on an envelope. After awhile he looks up from his writing and you look each other in the eyes.\n"You have a great future," he says abruptly.\n"How can you tell," you ask.\n"By looking at your face."\n"Just by that?"\n"Just so."\nAs you are talking, you notice two elaborately dressed men approaching from the end of the car. They whisper a few words to the President. He excuses himself, shakes hands with you, and tells one of his soldiers to see that you are provided for in Gettysburg.\nWhen you arrive at Gettysburg, one of the soldiers takes you to a family who welcomes you warmly and agrees to put you up for awhile, if you will help them out with their farm.\nYou find it amazing to be living in a time with no cars, radios, television, record players, or even telephones. It's peaceful--at least when there is not a war going on--but you feel homesick. You feel the great future the President predicted for you lies in your own time, and you resolve to find your way back to the Cave of Time.
THE END

Part.8c  It's less than a mile to Parkersville, and the President shakes your hand and wishes you luck. One of the soldiers arranges with the station agent for a carriage to take you to a farm owned by an old friend of his.\nYou soon become a member of the family. They are good people and make you feel very much at home. You are surprised to learn, however, that they plan to sell their farm and move to California. The new life in the West they describe is so appealing that you decide to go with them.\nYou never regret it, except, sometimes, you wish you could see your own time again.
THE END

Part.8d  Your hosts give you a fine bedroom with large windows overlooking the park on one side. On another wall is a beautiful painting of the California seacoast. When you push a button, the painting folds up to the ceiling, revealing a large screen. Your room contains a computer terminal that enables you to select any movie or other program you desire from over 10,000 possibilities. There are even films where you are the main character and you can make choices as to what will happen next in the story. Then, if you don't like the way the plot is working out, you can go back to an earlier point and make different choices from then on.\nOn your terminal you can also play games and flash pages of books or magazines on the screen. You can live quite well without even getting out of bed.\nEventually you go exploring. You meet other people, but you find none of them very interesting, so you spend most of your time watching the greatest movies of all time. Gradually you settle into your new life. One thing disturbs you. No one has made any new movies in the last 300 years.
THE END

Part.8e  There is something deadening about the perfect future society that makes you want to return to your own time as quickly as possible. With a brief word of farewell, you hurry back to the tunnel, climb down, and find a fork to the right that you hope will take you toward the right time. Soon you are climbing up toward the surface, excited about the discovery you are about to make.\nWhen you reach the surface, it is completely dark. A chill wind is blowing. You sit resolutely waiting for dawn so that you can see what kind of a world you are in. Meanwhile, there is no way of telling what time it is, either by your watch or by the stars.\nYou hear loud, clicking sounds all around you, mostly in the distance, but some quite close. As the orange-pink glow of oncoming dawn lightens the eastern sky, you see nearby the shape of a creature that is the size of a sheep but has a very different appearance.
THE END

Part.8f  Your friends are understanding about your wish to find the way back to your own time, but they tell you they can show you something you never dreamed of. Since their society is very primitive, you wonder what they could have in mind.\nNext day they lead you to another cove where the waves roll in, rise up against the cliff and then roll out again. Sometimes the waves clap against each other and send a foamy spray of water high in the air. You see some young people on tiny rafts--nothing more than surfboards--riding in on the crests of the waves and then riding them out on the rebound. In a few hours you have learned a sport that brings excitement and fascination for hour after hour.\nWith such delights as this, it is not long before you lose interest in returning to your own time. Sometimes you wonder, but you never learn, whether this paradise lies in the future or the past.
THE END

Part.8g  You hug your friends good-bye and climb the ridge bordering the jungle. You soon find an animal trail leading through the dense undergrowth into a tropical rain forest. The green canopy of treetops is far overhead and only an occasional dapple of sunlight reaches the spongy, dark ground. You walk on and on, hoping to reach the mountains, where you might find another entrance to the Cave of Time.\nNight falls and you make yourself a crude bed. Your mattress is the mossy floor of the forest. You spread out fern leaves for a sheet. Early the next morning, as the birds are beginning their morning songs, you are awakened by the boa constrictor wrapped around your neck.
THE END

Part.8h  You sit down and rest your chin in your hands, unable to believe the fate that has befallen you. To live forever in a timeless world seems worse than death.\n"Well, to tell the truth, there is a way to get back to your own time," the woman finally says, "but if you follow it, you will not be able to live forever."\n"l don't care," you say. "Show me the way."\n"Very well," she says, shaking her head in disbelief. "Dive under the rock ledge beneath me and swim through the tunnel you will find there. You will come up in your own time. Don't worry, it's only a few yards. You can make it."\nYou take a last look around, wave good-bye and dive. A few seconds later you surface in a pond just inside the entrance of the Cave of Time. You swim to shore and run out through the cave entrance into the open air, almost crashing into your Uncle Howard, who has come looking for you.\n"You're late for dinner," he says. "We wondered what happened to you. You ought to keep better track of the time."
THE END

Part.8i  Inside the cave again, you feel depressed and confused. Your eyes do not seem to be getting used to the dim light. You cannot find any passageways leading to other times. You feel increasingly drowsy. Soon you fall asleep on the cold clay floor of the cave.\nSometime later you awaken. The cave is pitch dark, but the bright light at the opening tells you the sun is shining brightly outside. You walk out into the daylight and, to your surprise and delight, you see Snake Canyon, the trail, the grove of pine trees nearby--everything just as it was when you entered the cave. Even the sun is in the same place, just about to pass behind the rim of the canyon. Somehow you have returned to your own time--or more precisely, the time it was before you fell asleep in the cave.\nYou rub your eyes and start down the path back to the Red Creek Ranch with a story to tell that no one will believe, but that you will never forget.
THE END

Part.8j  Reasoning that you can always find your way back into the cave when you want to, you decide to explore the world in which you have found yourself.\nYou make your way along a rock ledge overlooking the plains and lakes, taking care to keep your bearings so you can find your way back to the cave.\nBy now you are getting very hungry. You know that you are in the age of reptiles--at least 100 million years ago--and that mammals may not yet have appeared on earth. There will be no rabbits or deer to hunt, though the lakes may contain fish. You wonder how dinosaur eggs taste.\nYou follow a wide path through the fern trees. When you round the first bend, you find yourself face to face with the horrible Triceratops, a great gray monster almost hidden behind its shields and horns. It looks at you curiously with dull brown eyes. You turn, run, and crash into a tree trunk--one that wasn't there before! The bark feels like leather. You look up to see how high it is--into the jaws of Tyrannosaurus Rex.
THE END

Part.8k  You accept the offer, for you can hardly expect a better life at this point, and soon you begin to enjoy rowing out in the early morning mists and spreading your nets with the neighboring fishermen.\nOne afternoon, as the people are pulling up their boats for the night, you friend, Angus McPhee, raises a cry and points at the water. You look out and see the great head and neck of a sea monster--a huge dragon of the lake. Nearby, splinters of wood are floating in the water.\n"That was Sutherland's boat," Angus cries out. "It's been a hundred years since the monster has been seen, but now it has returned!"\nThe monster swims away and soon is lost from view in the mists.\n"How could the monster be gone for a hundred years and then return?" you ask Angus.\n"Somewhere near Beatty's Point," he replies, "there is an underwater cave where the monster stays as long as it pleases--because it is a Cave of Time."\nIf only you could find your way back to the Cave of Time! But chances seem slim, and the risks seem great.
Choice.8k.9a Try to find the Cave of Time.
Choice.8k.9b Do not try.
p8k  image vol3_files/vol3_picture8k.jpg

Part.8l  You'd rather spend the rest of your life searching for an entrance to the Cave of Time than settle for the placid life of a fishing village. So you bid your new friends farewell and set out over the countryside, headed south for London. Your goal is to find a ship to take you to America, though you know America hasn't been discovered yet, for somehow you must find your way back to Red Creek Canyon and the Cave of Time.\nA few hours later, as you are walking on a road along the edge of the forest, some burly men ride out from behind a clump of trees.\n"We've got you," one shouts. "You're the one who escaped from the tower, aren't you?" They force you upon a horse and ride at top speed toward the castle.\n"The penalty for escaping from the tower is hanging," one of them tells you.\nYou find out he is right.
THE END

Part.8m  In a moment you are across the bridge and galloping over the countryside, feeling a good deal smarter than the King and his knights. When you pass some shepherds and wave, they wave back.\nYou stop to rest at the cottage of a friendly goatherd, who feeds you a good dinner. "Do not fear the King," he says. "He is a fool who sits and drinks grog all day. His only concern is deciding who to put in the tower. His own knights laugh at him, and he is more likely to fall from his throne than you from your horse. Be off now and on to Merrie England, for great things await you there. God speed and good fortune!"\nYour energies are renewed by good food and drink, and your horse too is ready to ride. You thank your host warmly and ride off to new adventures and a new life--almost a thousand years before you are born.
THE END
p8m  image vol3_files/vol3_picture8m.jpg

Part.8n  You gain entrance to the King and thank him for letting you out of the tower.\n"Think nothing of it," the King replies. "We would do as much for any villain. We like your spirit and, though your story makes as much sense as a dancing mule, it brought laughter to our eyes. You have, without meaning it we are sure, performed a service for your King. We thank you.\n"We'll see that you have a horse and some pieces of gold," the King continues. "Go and make your fortune. We command you though--come once a year and tell us a story no less amusing than what we have heard from your lips."\n"My lord," you say.\n"My excellent vassal," he replies.\nYou ride off, somewhat apprehensive, but intent upon making as much of your life as is possible in the year 982.
THE END

Part.9a  One day when the sun is bright and the water as warm as it's likely to get, you take an old skiff and row to Beatty's Point. You pull your boat up on the rocky shoal that marks the cave. You dive again and again along the rock wall that drops into the depths until you find the entrance. You swim a few feet inside and find you can get up to the surface inside an enormous cavern, most of it filled by an underground lake.\nYou reach the shore and walk along the lakeside, deeper and deeper into the cavern, which is lit by a mysterious blue light. Then, ahead, you see what you had hoped to find--a tunnel that surely must lead to the Cave of Time. Nearby in the sand are three eggs as large as footballs. You pick one up and carry it into the tunnel. After walking awhile, the air becomes hard to breathe. You begin to feel dizzy and fall unconscious to the ground, still clutching the enormous egg.\nYou are awakened by a fresh breeze blowing toward you. You dizzily get to your feet, pick up the egg, and hurry toward the fresh air--outdoors again in Snake Canyon! Everything is as you remember it and in a few hours you are walking up to the ranch, where your uncle says he is surprised you got back so quickly!\nWhen you tell what has happened to you, no one at the ranch believes it, though they are fascinated by your enormous egg.\n"Maybe we'll believe that egg is real--and believe your story--if it will hatch a monster," your uncle says, "or if you break it open to show us what's inside."
Choice.9a.10a Break the egg open.
Choice.9a.10b Keep it in your closet until you have a chance to get scientific advice.

Part.9b  The idea that the Loch Ness monster goes into the Cave of Time for a hundred years or so before returning seems preposterous. And, even if it does, it seems very doubtful you could dive down deep enough to find the underwater entrance. So you resign yourself to making a living fishing the waters of Loch Ness.\nYou find it a tolerable, though not very interesting, life. You particularly like rowing out in your skiff in the early morning mists and watching the pale, red sun struggling io shine through the haze. That's what you are doing one day when you feel a tremendous thump under your boat, the stern is heaved high into the air, and you are hurled over the bow and into the jaws of the monster.\nSome of your friends find the wreckage of your boat later in the day and, throughout the village, people say to each other--"The monster has returned again."
THE END
p9b  image vol3_files/vol3_picture9b.jpg

Part.10a With your aunt and uncle and some ranch hands standing by, you very gently tap the egg with an axe, hoping it will split open without fragmenting.\n"Wait a minute!" Uncle Howard cries out. "I'm ready to believe you, but I think we better get a naturalist down from the University to see this first."\nYou are relieved that your uncle feels this way, because it seems like a terrible responsibility--cracking open an egg like that and possibly killing a rare monster before it is born.\nUncle Howard calls the naturalist, a famous professor of paleontology, who agrees to come down the following Saturday. You place the egg in a large bowl in the middle of the dining room table.\nThe next day is Friday, and that evening the whole family goes out to the movies. When you return, you find the house has been broken into and the egg is missing.\nNeither you, your aunt and uncle, nor any of the ranch hands, nor the police are ever able to find the egg. Most people you tell your story to just smile and say, "Sure." But Uncle Howard, even though he is a skeptical man, tells you he knows you were telling the truth.
THE END
p10a image vol3_files/vol3_picture10a.jpg

Part.10b  The next day you call the Department of Zoology at a nearby university, where you are referred to Dr. Henry Karn, a specialist in large reptiles. Dr. Karn is skeptical about the egg but agrees to drive to Red Creek Ranch immediately to see it.\nBy the time he arrives, you are feeling very nervous. Suppose the egg is just made of plastic? Your concern is heightened by his stern appearance. He shakes hands brusquely with you and your uncle and immediately asks to see the egg.\nWhen you hand it to him, he says nothing while he stares intently at it, holds it up to the light, taps it and scratches it with a pen knife. Then he holds it to his ear.\nFinally he smiles at you and gently puts the egg down. "It's quite possible this is the egg of a Plesiosaurus, an aquatic dinosaur of the late Jurassic period. It is highly unlikely it will ever hatch. Even so, I would want to keep it in an incubator at the University for at least a year before breaking it open. I'll let you know, of course, if anything develops."\nA few weeks have passed since then and whenever the phone rings you wonder if Dr. Karn is calling.
