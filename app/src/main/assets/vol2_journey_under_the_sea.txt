Part.1a  You are an underwater explorer. You are leaving to explore the deepest oceans. You must find the lost city of Atlantis. This is your most challenging assignment.\nIt is morning and the sun pushes up on the horizon. The sea is calm. You climb into the narrow pilot's compartment of the underwater vessel Seeker with you special gear. The crew of the research vessel Maray screws down the hatch clamps. Now begins the plunge into the depths of the ocean. The Seeker crew begins lowering by a strong, but thin cable. Within minutes, you are so deep in the ocean that little light filters down to you. The silence is eerie as the Seeker slips deeper and deeper. You peer out the thick glass porthole and see fish drifting past, sometimes stopping to look at you-an intruder from another world.\nNow the cable attaching you to Maray is extended almost to its limit. You have come to rest on a ledge near the canyon in the ocean floor that supposedly leads to the lost city of Atlantis./nYou have a special sea suit that will protect you from the intense pressure of the deep if you choose to walk about on the sea bottom. You can cut loose from the cable if you wish because the Seeker is self-propelled. You are now in another world.
Choice.1a.2a Explore the ledge where the Seeker has come to rest.
Choice.1a.2b Cut loose from the Maray and dive with the Seeker into the canyon in the ocean floor.
p1a  image vol2_images/vol2_picture1.jpg

Part.2a  Your sea suit will protect you from the intense pressures of the deep. It is a tight fit and takes you some time to put it on. Finally, you slip from the airlock of the Seeker and stand on the ocean floor. It is a strange and marvelous world where you every move is slowed down. You begin to explore with your special hand-held searchlight. You examine the ledge by the canyon.\nSuddenly, a school of bright yellow angel fish dart by, almost brushing you. What made them move so fast? Are they being chased?\nThen you see it. The Seeker is in the grips of a huge sea monster. It is similar to a squid, but it is enormous. The Seeker is just a toy in its long powerful tentacles. You seek shelter behind a rock formation. You know the spear gun you carry will be useless against this monster. It looks as though it will destroy the Seeker. Fish of all sizes huddle with you in an attempt to escape the monster.
Choice.2a.3a Stay hidden close to the Seeker.
Choice.2a.3b Try to escape in the hope that rescuers will see you.
p2a  image vol2_images/vol2_picture1.jpg

Part.2b  You radio a status report to the Maray and tell them that you are going to cast off from the line and descend under your own power. Your plan is approved and you cast off your line. Now you are on your own. The Seeker slips noiselessly into the undersea canyon.\nAs you drop into the canyon, you turn on the Seeker's powerful searchlight. Straight ahead is a dark wall covered with a strange type of barnacle growth. To the left (port) side you see what appears to be a grotto. The entrance is perfectly round, as if it had been cut by human hands.\nLantern fish give off a pale, greenish light. To the right (starboard) side of the Seeker you see bubbles rising steadily from the floor of the canyon.
Choice.2b.3c Investigate the bubbles.
Choice.2b.3d Investigate the grotto with the round entrance.
p2b  image vol2_images/vol2_picture1.jpg

Part 3a\n The giant squid tosses and turns the Seeker, but finally the creature grows tired of its new game and jets off with an enormous squirt of water. You now are free to leave your hiding place and examine the Seeker for damage.\nTo your dismay, the airock entrance has been jammed shut. You are locked out of the Seeker. The crew of the Maray, however, suspected trouble when you did not respond to a routine radio check and they are now lowering an escape platform to you. Once on the platform, you radio them to start the slow pull to the surface. To avoid the bends-rappid expansion of nitrogen bubbles in your blood-they will have to bring you up very slowly.\nJust as the platform begins to move, the giant squid suddenly returns as if from nowhere. It is headed directly at you.
Choice.3a.4a Fight the squid with your spear gun, hoping to scare it off. /*pg 17*/
Choice.3a.4b Signal Maray to pull you up at top speed, knowing you will get the bends. /*pg 18*/

Part 3a\n Moving cautiously, you climb up the sides of the canyon hoping to reach the ocean floor. You leave the Seeker in the grips of the giant squid. Your plan is to signal for help with a dye marker that will float to the surface and make a bright yellow patch in the water. The crewmen above have been instructed to watch for such emergency signals. They will send help.\nOnce you reach the ledge above the canyon and feel slightly safter, you see the most feared of all sea creatures-a huge shark. It begins to circle twoards you and you know that you are its target. You wonder whether you should fire your emergency propulsion charge that will send you rapidly to the surface. The shark is fast; he might catch you anyway. You also know that you will get the bends from the rapid rise to the surface.
Choice.3b.4c Fire the special propulsion charge to get to the surface. /*pg 21*/
Choice.3b.4d Wait quietly hoping that the shark will go away. /*pg 19*/

Part.3c /*pg 8*/ Carefully, you maneuver the Seeker between the walls of the canyon.\nOn the floor of the canyon, you discover a large round hole out of which flow the large bubbles. The Seeker is equipped with scientific equipment to analyze the bubbles. It also has sonar equiment that can measure the depth of any hole.
Choice.3c.4e Analyze the bubbles. /*pg 11*/
Choice.3c.4f Take sonar readings. /*pg 15*/

Part.3d /*pg 9*/ You pilot the Seeker through the rounded entrance to the grotto. Once inside, your searchlight picks up what appear to be docks and piers along the grotto walls. The Seeker's searchlight is not very powerful. However, you do have a special laser light which would light up the grotto like daylight. Unfortunately, the laser light can only be used twice for very short periods before it must be recharged aboard the Maray, now more than 2,000 feet above you on the surface.
Choice.3d.4g Use the laser light. /*pg 16*/
Choice.3d.4h Cruise futher into the grotto. /*pg 14*/

Part.4a /*pg 17*/ With a rush of water, the giant squid attacks you. Two 20 foot tentacles with their pulsing suction cups reach out trying to ensnare you. You dive off the platform and rapidly fire two of your spears. They strike the squid close to its two monstrous eyes. But the squid keeps on coming.\nOne of the tentacles wraps around your diving helmet and ruptures the seal to your suit. You fire your last spear hoping to hit the monster in a vulnerable spot. Water is beginning to trickle into your suit. You signal the Maray to haul you up fast-"Emergency Hoist." You must have hit the squid. It floats away writhing and thrashing. You think you're about to black out.\nYou wake up on the deck of the Maray and are quickly rushed to the decompression chambers to ward off the effect of the bends. In a few days you are better and start to worry about diving into the abyss again.
Choice.4a.5a Quit the expedition now. /*pg 32*/
Choice.4a.5b Go back down to the deep. /*pg 33*/

Part.4b /*pg 18*/ As they begin the rapid hauling, you lose your ability to function in the deep. You start to get dizzy and your arms and legs feel weak. You lose your hold on the platforma dn drift in the water exhausted. Then you see a dolphin heading toward you. You know that these marvelous mammals sometimes hep people in trouble. Will it help you?
Choice.4b.5c Try to get help from the dolphin. /*pg 34*/
Choice.4b.5d Carry on alone swimming to the surface. /*pg 37*/

Part.4c /*pg 21*/ You fire the special propulsion charge and zoom upward through the water, frightening schools of fish as you go. You become dizzy and lose track of where you are. The world seems upside down. The shark is nowhere around, you hope. Then you break through to the suface floating about a half mile from the Maray.\nThe lookouts spot you in the water and quickly rescue you. Unfortunately, the rapid ascent has given you a bad case of the bends. It takes a long time to decompress. And when you are finally all right, the ship's doctor informs you that your underwater days are over. Someone else will have to find Atlantis. THE END

Part.4d /*pg 19*/ You wait for the shark to go away. But then you notice other sharks coming to join in the hunt. They circle you, coming closer and faster each time. It is too late. There is no escape! THE END

Part.4e /*pg 11*/ You squeeze into your sea suit and, outside the Seeker, you use special equipment to analyzer the bubbles. As you work, you clumsily knock against the valve that dumps the compressed air necessary to make the Seeker rise to the surface. There is nothing to be done about it; so you continue to analyzer the bubbles. They contain a high percentage of oxygen and no poisonous gases. Perhaps they are coming from some area below the sea where human-type beings can live and breathe. Perhaps they are coming from Atlantis./nYou wonder whether you should try the Seeker's drilling arm to enlarge the source of the bubbles so you can explore it with the Seeker. But you are also very worried about the Seeker's loss of riing capability. You might also be able to trap the bubbles and use them to raise the Seeker.
Choice.4e.5e Try to collect the bubbles coming from the hole to fill the tanks of the Seeker /*pg 24*/
Choice.4e.5f Decide to drill. /*pg 22*/

Part.4f /*pg 15*/ You maneuver the Seeker next to the hole and begin to take sonar readings to determine the depth of the hole. To your amazement, the sonar readings indicate that the hole is extraordinarily deep-it might reach the center of the earth!\nWhat lies down there? Where are the bubbles coming from? Is Atlantis beneath you?\nThen you notice a disturbing reading on your instruments; a mild earthquake has occurred. The Seeker is not damaged, but the eathquake could set up a tsunami wave on the surface causing the Maray to leave for sager areas. It might be dangerous not to get back to the surface and leave with the Maray. On the other hand, you are perhaps on the verge of one of the world's greatest discoveries.
Choice.4f.5g Descend into the hole. /*pg 23*/
Choice.4f.5h Return to the surface. /*pg 27*/

Part.4g /*pg 16*/ The beam from the laser light illuminates the entire grotto. Far back on the floor of the grotto is a submarie! Cautiously, you maneuver the Seeker closer. You identify it as athe submarine that syteriously disappered in the Bermuda Triangle almost a year before. The Bermuda Triangle is more than 2000 miles away.\nThe submarine is apparently not damaged, but it is covered with a slimy algae. Beautiful fish swim around it as though it is their own special prize. Then you notice that the main tach is free of algae!
Choice.4g.5i Try to enter the submarine. /*pg 29*/
Choice.4g.5j Cruise on through the grotto. /*pg 31*/

Part.4h /*pg 14*/ You cruise silently into the grotto. Its roof seems to slope upward and you follow the slope. The depth finder shows that you are rising quite rapidly. Perhaps you will reach the surface and open air. Then the roof of the crotto stops sloping upward. Before you is a perfectly round metallic hatch made of a metal that you have never seen before. With the mechanical arm of the Seeker you try to open the hatch. It will not open. You begin to send radio signals at the door hoping to make contact on the other side.
Choice.4h.5k Blow the hatch open with an explosiv charge. /*pg 26*/
Choice.4h.5l Continue transmitting radio communications through the hatch. /*pg 28*/

Part.5a /*pg 32*/ With great sorrow, you decide that it is wisest to leave the expedition now. You can't risk returning to the great depths below. So, you reluctantly return to the United States.\nYou are invited to tell of your adventures on several major television shows. While on one such show, a special news flash announces to the world the discovery of Atlantis. You regret your decision, but you didn't really have a choise. Did you? THE END

Part.5b /*pg 33*/ You can't resist the adventure beneath the sea. You must go down again, and after several weeks of rest, you enter the Seeker and slip quickly into the deep. You bring the Seeker to rest by the great canyon in the ocean bottom and, wearing your special suit, you venture out into the depths. There are no signs of the giant squid and you feel safe.\nRounding a rock formation, you come upon the wreck of an ancient Greed ship. Howe strange to find this ship, intact, so far below the surface. What brought it here? Was it visiting Atlantis before the lost continent slipped beneath the sea?\nYou take pictures and make notes in your special undersea book. Maybe this ancient ship hides the secret to Atlantis.
Choice.5b.6a Go aboard the Greek ship. /*pg 45*/
Choice.5b.6b Return to the surface to report your findings. /*pg 46*/

Part.5c /*pg 34*/ The dolphin looks at you, and you even imagine that he is smiling at you. You grab one of his flippers and with a powerful switch of his body, the dolphin swims upward. In a short time, you break through to the surface. You blink in the bright sun. The Maray is nowhere in sight. You are lost far at sea.\nThe dolphin dives beneath the surface with you still clinging to him. He speeds off an within 20 minutes you are next to the Maray. The dolphin must have heard the Maray's engine noises underneath the water.\mOnce aboard, everyone congratulates you on your escape. You will go down again, but the thought keeps haunting you: What is your luck has run out?
Choice.5c.6c Dive again the next day. /*pg 48*/
Choice.5c.6d Give up the expedition. /*pg 47*/

Part.5d /*pg 37*/ The dolphin might help you and might not. You decide to chance it alone. So, up you head, swimming towards the surface. The dolphin follows for some time, and then swims off. You rest for awhile about 300 feet below the surface before your final ascent.\nThen a large fish-ugly, lumpy, puffed up, and covered with black and white markings swims towards you. Its bulging eyes fasten on you. It is a big-mouthed grouper, a fish which does not bother to bite its victims, but simply swallows them whole.\nIt looks as though you are its next meal. THE END

Part.5e /*pg 24*/ You are able to capture the bubbling gases and fill the tanks of the Seeker, enought to allow it to rise. Slowly, the Seeker rises out of the canyon, scattering schools of brightly colored fish, and brushing past underwater plants that wave like palm trees in a wind. Just as you reach the ledge at the top of the canyon, you see what appears to be an old road! Rocks along its side seem to be guard rails. Could this be a path that leads to the lost city of Atlantis? You anchor the Seeker and prepare to investigate more closely. /*to pg 6=Part.2a*/

Part.5f /*pg 22*/ As you begin to drill, the stream of bubbles increases.\nThe stream of bubbles is strong enough now to ruffle the surface of the sea. You could try to surface now and locate the exact position of the bubble area. Then you could make plans with the scientists aboard the Maray about what to do next. But also, you could simply explore the bubbles now! There is great risk in entering the hole, but it could lead to the source of the bubbles and maybe to Atlantis.
Choice.5d.6e Explore. /*pg 38*/
Choice.5d.6f Try to surface /*pg 35*/

Part.5g /*pg 23*/ Now is the time for decision. You check all the controls of the Seeker, grit your teath, and push the control column into the deep dive position. Down, down you go where no person has ever ventured. The Seeker is build for deep, deep dives, but you are descending rapidly milw after mile into the deep. The pressure is intense, the darkness is complete, and the depth guage indicates an incredible 15 miles. You quickly reverse the control column. Warning lights flare up on your control puanel; they show that gravitational forces are now stronger than the Seeker's propulsion motors. You have passed the point of no return and your journy downward will contrinue in utter darkness until the water pressure is too great for the Seeker. This is the final voyage. THE END

Part.5h /*pg 27*/ Deciding to return to the surface, you direct the Seeker cuatiously back along the side of the canyon in the ocean floor. Without warning, the Seekers is gripped in a powerful current that sweeps it toward a grotto. Once in the grotto, the current carries you to what appears to be a large metal door. It swings open and the Seeker is swpet inside. The door closes, the water in the grotto drains away, and yuo step out into a chamber that you decide must be made by human hands.\nA door opens in the wall, two people dressed in simple clothes come towards you. One of them says, "Welcome to Atlantis. We have been expecting you."\nWhat a discovery! You have found the lost continent and its civilization. The two people tell you that although citizens of Atlantis occasionally journey to the upper world, anyone who happens upon Atlantis is never permitted to leave. The Atlanteans are not cruel but fear discovery of their world.\nThey want you to follow them and you agree. But you have another thought. Perhaps you could blast your way out of the chamber with the Seeker's laser cannon.
Choice.5h.6g Follow the people and join the Atlantean society. /*pg 39*/
Choice.5h.6h Make a dash for the Seeker and try to blast through the closed door with the laser cannon. /*pg 40*/

Part.5i /*pg 29*/ The submarine is indeed mysterious. You now have on your sea suit and you open the hatch on the conning tower and enter the sub. It is amazingly clean and in order. There are no signs of life, but there are also no signs of struggle or trouble. In the control room, you see a piece of mystifying equipment that just doesn't belong on this sub.\nA voice begins telling you that, thousands of years ago, the leaders of Atlantis realized that their continent was slipping into the sea. They discovered a large underground cavern and build new forms of living quarters for their people. Later when Atlantis was deep beneath the ocean, some of the scientists discovered and perfected an operation enabling them to breathe under water.\nThe voice, which sounds friendly, also tells you that there are two groups in Atlantis. One group is good and the other is evil. The voice invites you to enter the world of Atlantis and gives directions and instructions to a secret passageway to the underwater cit.\nAs you follow directions, you spy an unbelievable underwater craft with several people in it. It must be an Atlantean ship, but are the people good or evil? Do they know of the secret passageway?
Choice.5i.6i Hurry in, trying to reach the secret passageway without being seen. /*pg 43*/
Choice.5i.6j Rush back to the Seeker trying to escape danger. /*pg 44*/

Part.5j /*pg 31*/ You cruise through the grotto past the wreck of the submarine and then you spot another ship wreck. And then another. They, too, are covered with algae, but they appear undamaged. Maybe people from Atlantis capture ships in the Bermuda Triangle and bring the here. Then you see another ship, but this one is a three-masted schooner of the type used in the early 1800s. Its rigging is gestooned with algae, and fish swim lazily around its mast.\nYour curiosity captures you and you put on your sea suit. Leaving the Seeker, you move towards the old sailing ship. Suddenly a thirteen-foot long deadly poisonous sea snake strikes from behind the forward cabin and bites you in the soft flesh between the fungers of your right hand. There is no antidote to the deadly poison. THE END

Part.5k /*pg 26*/ The only way to get beyond the door is to blast it away, or so you believe. The Seeker's laser cannon is powerful and you position the Seeker to fire. Pushing the fire button, you send a powerful beam at the hatch. Nothing happens. Then you advance the cannon control to full emergency force. Again you push the button and the beam dissolves the hatch instantly. A flood of sea water rushes into the giant hole, carrying you with it into an air-filled cavern beyond. The water fills the cavern with speed and explosive force. You see several people scurring towards excape hatchers. IT IS TOO LATE! You did the wrong thing. THE END

Part.5l /*pg 28*/ The radio transmissions seem to be failing, and you grow tired of sending signals through the closed door. You are just about to give up when the door suddenly swings open revealing behind it a cavern with another door. You enter the cavern cautiously and receive a radio signal in English. It tells you that you are welcome here, but that once you enter this place, you may never return to the world abouve. It is up to you to decide.
Choice.5l.6k Go on and investigate what might be Atlantis. /*pg 41*/
Choice.5l.6l Retreat. /*pg 42*/

Part.6a /*pg 45*/ Cautiously you enter the ship's cabin. Clay jugs called amphorae, once filled with oils and wines, are strewn about. There are no remains of the crew. You do have a sense of being in ancient Greece and it is a strange feeling.\nA door leads to a smaller cabin. On a table near the rear of this cabin is a golden box. You open it and find the remains of a map. Id does not show Atlantis. It shows that the ship was searching for a hole that leads to the center of the earth!\nYou return to the Seeker and use the map to locate the incredible shaft to the center of the earth. Using some guesswork to interpret the map, you discover the tunnel opening, which appears to be roughly 100 feet in diameter. The sonar readings indicate the hole has no bottom.
Choice.6a.7a Descend into the hole. /*pg 65*/
Choice.6a.7b It is time to go abck up to the surface. /*pg 66*/

Part.6b /*pg 46*/ The trip back to the surface is smooth, and finally the Seeker is hauled aboard the Maray. You climb out and are greeted by the scientists and crew. The Seeker is prepared for the second dive, but suddenly the wind rises and the sea kicks up into furious waves that crash over the deck of the Maray. All hands rush to prepare for hurricane force winds. There is no chance for the second dive to begin. All day and all night the Maray pitches on the stormy sea.\nThe next morning the wind has died and the sky clear. You are now ready to dive again. /*to pg 48=Part.6c*/

Part.6c /*pg 48*/ Again the Seeker is lowered over the side of the Maray and slips into the ocean. Fish swim by peering cautiously at you in your metal shell. The sunlight faeds as you descend into the abyss.\nYou are headed for the giant canyon below that might lead to Atlantis. When you reach the canyon you switch on the Seeker's searchlight. Immediately you spot the round hole that appears to be made by intellignt beings. Perhaps it leads to Atlantis. /*to pg 9=Part.3d*/

Part.6d /*pg 47*/ A helicopter is sent to pick you up and return you to an air base for a flight back to the United States. Newspaper reports indicate that the search for Atlantis has been given up. Several months later, however, a group of scientists get in touch with you because they believe that Atlantis can be found. They have put together another expedition and want you to join it. You are tempted. Andventure into the unknown is what you like. THE END

Part.6e /*pg 38*/ You decide to guide the Seeker into the new passageway to the bubble source. Suddenly the Seeker is swept downward as if pulled by a giant magnet. You lose consciousness. When you awake, you are in a well-lighted and comfortable room. Three people are standing clost to you They look normal and appear to be friendly.\nThe middle one speaks. "You are in the nether region of Atlantis. This is a visitors' reception room. If you wish to come into the city of Atlantis, then follow us; but you may never return to your world. If you wish to leave now, we will escort you safely to the surface. It is your choice. We do not wish to harm you."
Choice.6c.7c Follow them into the city of Atlantis, /*pg 55*/
Choice.6c.7d Return to the surface. /*pg 51*/

Part.6f /*pg 35*/ You suddenly realize the stream of bubles i powerful enough to raise the Seeker. You guide the Seeker into the bubble stream and it heads toward the surface. As you swirl upward, you begin to notice increasing amounts of brown kelp-seaweed. The instruments in the Seeker indicate that the propellers and the steering mechanisms will not work.\nYou put on your sea suit and go out to see what can be done. Once outside in the kelp, you realize that you can't free the Seeker. You start to swim for the surface but then you are soon completely stuck in the clinging seaweed. You are trapped and unable to go forward or return to the Seeker.
Choice.6f.7e Keep struggling towards the surface. /*pg 50*/
Choice.6f.7f Rest quietly, gain strength, and work out a plan. /*pg 53*/

Part.6g /*pg 39*/ You are led to a room. The floors are a rich marble. The walls glow. The ceiling is like being inside a diamond looking through the many facets.\nA person who immediately commands respect becons you with firmness and kindness to come to her.\n"Welcome to Atlantis. Thousands of years ago we learned that we were about to slip into the sea. Our people prepared for the calamity by building a new city inside an extinct volcano. We have lived here in peace and harmony ever since. We have no sunlight, nor stars to gaze at, but we have other spaces to meditate upon."\nShe tells you about a group of people called the Nodoors. If you wish, you can live with them, but you cannot leave Atlantis.\nA bearded man is to be your escort. Atlantis is a beatiful city. Buildings merge one into another, colors radiate light, and coral branches fill coutyards. There is a sense of well-being and peave.\nIt would be pleasant here, but you don't want to be a prisoner. Maybe there would be a better chance to escape if you join the Nodoors. You ask your guide about them.\n"Oh, we believe they are dangerous, but we don't really know. They live in the center of the old volcano. If you wish, I can take you there."
Choice.6g.7g Join the Nodoors /*pg 56*/
Choice.6g.7h Remain with the Atlanteans and perhaps get a chance to escape. /*pg 57*/

Part.6h /*pg 40*/ The Atlanteans have lived in peace for thousands of years. They have no love of warfare. Their civilization is technologically very advanced and a sensing mechanism tells them that you are about to use your laser cannon. They quickly fire a special beam at the Seeker to tell you to come with them to Atlantis.\n"You are now part of Atlantis. We understand your fear, but do not be frightened. No harm will come to you and your life will be full. Follow us."\nAs you walk with them, into a new world, you wonder if you will ever see the sky again. THE END

Part.6i /*pg 43*/ You escape being seen by the submarine craft. Following the instructions you enter a passageway. At the end of the passageway is an airlock door and beyond it an incredibly large air-filled cavern. Perhaps it is the inside of an extinct volcano.\nThe land is pleasant, although strange to your experience. A soft substance covers the ground. It seems to be alive. You can't tell. A gentle light comes from the sides of this huge cavern. It reminds you of early morning light just before the sun rises.\nA group of people approach you with friendly gestures. They are wearing simple clothes much like the clothes people wore in ancient Greece. They are kind and generous. You remove your diving suit to find that the air is good to breathe.\nThese people speak a language that is unknown to you, but one of them acts as an interpreter. You find out that this is Atlantis. They tell you it is governed by a man who is greedy, selfish, and dangerous. The people are like slaves. Everyone is unhappy except a few who serve the ruler as his lieutenants. These new friends ask for your help. Perhaps you can help them escape.
Choice.6i.7i Leave your new friends and search for the ruler. /*pg 60*/
Choice.6i.7j Help your new friends escape. /*pg 61*/

Part.6j /*pg 44*/ Quickly you get into the Seeker in an attempt to escape the strange submarine. You notice that the sub is chasing you so you put on full emergency ascent power. You could use your laser cannon to blast the sub, but you do not wish to hurt anyone.\nThe ascent towards the surface is swift, but a few fathoms from the surface all systems on the Seeker fail. You are suspended in the water in a helpless position. It seems that a mysterious force has disabled you.
Choice.6j.7k Wait on board the Seeker for help from the Maray. /*pg 64*/
Choice.6j.7l Try to escape from the Seeker and try for the surface on your own. /*pg 63*/

Part.6k /*pg 41*/ You are greeted by a group of people who look like ordinary human beings except that there are gill-like slits on their necks. Their bare feet have skin between the toes forming a web. They order you to put on your sea suit, pull you quickly from the Seeker, and lead you towards their city. On the way they show you the zoo where there are animals from the world above the sea. There is a glass-like cage surrounding them filled with air, allowing them to live below the sea.\nThe leader of the group explains that if you wish you may either submit to an operation to have gills inserted so that you may breathe underwater, or you may join the other animals in the zoo.
Choice.6k.7m Agree to the operation. /*pg 58*/
Choice.6k.7n /*pg 41*/ Go to the zoo. /*pg 59*/

Part.6l /*pg 42*/ Back aboard the Seeker, you radio the Maray that you are surfacing to make a plan. While rising out of the giant crevice-like canyon, you spot what appears to be a road running along the top of the ledge. What is this? The scientists aboard the Maray had mentioned the possibilities of finding signs of the ancient civilization, such as roads. You must investigate. /*to pg 6=Part.2a*/

Part.7a /*pg 65*/ Why not go? Who would believe it? The center of the earth! You push the control column forward and dive deep. Soon there is no more water, just a heavy gas that acts like water. You look at a world of colors and drifting forms. You pass by layers of rock and sand. Suddenly you sail into a gooey mass which almost fouls the Seeker's propellers. Then the Seeker's engine stops are you are pulled along through the semi-liquid material by something like gravity or magnetism. You burst through a thick elastic membrane and enter an area of giant atoms. Electrons whirl around you at high speed, but there is plenty of room to maneuver between these fast-moving particles. The electrons are revolving around a small mass you know is called the nucleus. You are able to avoid collisions with the electrons. What a world! Maybe you are having hallucinations.
Choice.7a.8a Continue on in this trip to the center of the earth. /*pg 88*/
Choice.7a.8b Try to turn back. /*pg 89*/

Part.7b /*pg 66*/ You face the fact that it is too dangerous to dive into a deep hole that might lead to the center of the earth. It is better judgment to return to the surface and work out a plan of action.\nYou give one last look at the opening, check the Seeker's instruments and head up to the surface. Finally the Seeker breaks through into fresh air and sublight and you wait to be picked up by the Maray. /*to pg 32=Part.5a*/

Part.7c /*pg 55*/ The three people lead you into an enormous cavern. In the center of the cavern is a huge, silver-colored machine. It is shaped like a long tube with several round panels attached to one end.\nThey lead you inside. It is the most advanced control room that you have ever seen. Computers, sensig device, recording devices, monitors, and a host of dials and panels fills the room. A stragely shaped figure with a very large head and totally blank eyes faces you.\n"So, now you are in the control room of Atlantis. You see our secret.

Part.7d /*pg 51*/ Three people of Atlantis sense your wish to return to the surface. Instantly, they produce a bubble-shaped capsule and put you inside.\n"Farewell, earth person. May you live a long and prosperous life."\nYou shoot up swiftly through the sea and break out onto the surface near the Maray. The capsule that protected you disintegrates upon reaching the surface. Once aboard the Maray, you tell the crew and the scientists about your adventure. They are kind to you, but no one believes you. They think you have imagined the world of Atlantis as a result of being so deep for so long.\nBack in the United States, you begin a television tour telling about Atlantis. You write articles and a book. You are paid a great deal of money for this work. You are tempted to use this money for another expedition.

Part.7e /*pg 50*/ You are dizzy from lack of oxygen and fatigue. With your knife you slash away at the heavy brown kelp that surrounds you. Bit by bit, you seem to be getting free.

Within a few moments you are safely aboard, surrounded by your friends. What a relief to be out of that nightmare world!

Choice.7e.8h Rest a few days and make emergency plans. /*pg 68*/

Part.7g /*pg 56*/ "I wish to join the Nodoors," you tell your guide. He leads you to the outskirts of the city.\n"I must leave you now. Good luck." The Nodoors send a greeting party that is heavily armed. They are suspicious of you and believe that you are a spy sent by the Atlanteans. They look exactly like the Atlanteans, but they rarely smile.\n"Come with us. You must be questioned. Perhaps you will work for us."\nFor 3 days you are questioned and kept in a small room without windows. These people are not kind and you believe that you have made a mistake. They ask you to help them spy on the Atlanteans. They suggest that, as a spy, you could pass freely between both groups.
Choice.7g.8k Decide to escape. /*pg 75*/
Choice.7g.8l Decide to accept their offer. /*pg 76*/

Part.7h /*pg 57*/ You decide to remain with the Atlanteans. Their approach to life seems ideal. Time is spent in creating things to help life and not to destroy it. You believe their leader is speaking the truth when she tells of avoiding war and of not hating.\nYou are fascinated by the apparently ideal world. You would like to stay and search out the histroy of how Atlantis became what it is and what caused the splite between the Atlanteans and the Nodoors.

Part.7i /*pg 60*/ It doesn't take you long to find the king. One of his countless agents leads you to him. He is in a small simple room with a strange light glowing from the rounded ceiling.\n"So, you have found your way here after all. Put your mind at rest. I won't hurt you." The king's booming voice startles you. He invites you to sit down.\nAfter several hours with the king, you find him to be bright, friendly, and interesting. Maybe the Atlanteans are wrong about this person.\nHe offers you a chance to join his government. He tells you that most people are lazy and selfish and deserve to be ruled with power and command. He has been king for almost 1000 years and he has survived because he is not afraid to be tough. He wants you to be an advisor on his staff.
Choice.7i.8o Accept the king's offer and work for him. /*pg 80*/
Choice.7i.8p Refuse and go back to join the other people. /*pg 82*/

Part.7j /*pg 61*/ The problem is where do they escape to? The king is in charge. He rules the world below the sea and his spies are everywhere. The only answer is to devise a plan to capture the king and put him in prison.\nThe people are frightened. Some citizens tried to revolt years before and are still in prison. The kind is smart and suspicious of everyone.\nYou suggest a plan to put on a festival with a play. On a given signal the actors and the people in the audience will rise up and seize the king. The actors will be carrying real weapons, but no one will suspect them because they are in the play.\nThe people like the plan. They ask you to become their leader.

Part.7n

Part.8a /*pg 88*/ The electrons whirl about at dizzy speeds and you continue until you get to a spot where your instruments indicate that there is not time. The clocks stop, the speed indicator stops, you heart stops, and yet you are alive. Every sense in your boby seems more alive than ever before. You hear beautifu music and see lights that you feel and taste as well. Peave and well-being fill you.\nYou become aware of other beings close to you. No one hase entered through the only hatch and yet there are other presences in the Seeker. Turning around, you see three Atlanteans. Then you feel that the Seeker has become just a thought and that the people from Atlantis have entered your mind and you are aboard the Seeker. You try to enter their thoughts, but they tell you that you have not journeyed far enough yet to be able to become a though-traveler.
Choice.8a.9a Try to turn back from this strange world. /*pg 95*/
Choice.8a.9b Travel in thought-time-space. /*pg 96*/

Part.8b /*pg 89*/ No, you will not dive down toward the center of the earth. Once through the thin outer layer of the earth, you know that the regions beneath change from solid to molten and then to a hard core. At least that is the theory given by the scientists. You couldn't possibly survive such a journey. Anyway, you think that your sonar gear is probably not working correctly. The hole is deep, but you don't believe that it really goes all the way to the center of the earth. Caution is your appraoch. You go back to the surface to consult with the scientists aboard the Maray.\nThe scientists tell you that their instruments have been damaged, perhaps by an approaching storm, and they too, are cautious. They decide to move the Maray away from the site of the mysterious hole. The expedition retreats and you now your distance to discover Atlantis has slipped away. THE END

Part.8c /*pg 71*/ Perhaps you are being foolish, but you decide to join them. The injection is painless and you feel no different than before. They lead you to a comfortable room where you all share a special tea in celebration of your decision.\n"You see, all living beings are basically the same. Everything is connected in life. We have come from a different planet in search of other living beings. We have to be very careful about taking new people to our planet. Some of your people seek us out, just like you. We choose carefully."\nYou are amazed at what they say. A choice is given to you. You can either journey with them through time and space to their planet, or you can remain in underwater Atlantis as a worker recording information about life on earth.
Choice.8c.9c Decide to travel with them in space and time. /*pg 90*/
Choice.8c.9d Decide to stay in Atlantis as a worker. /*pg 91*/

Part.9a /*pg 95*/ This is too much for you. It is like a nightmare and you decide to turn back. But going back is much harder than you expected. The electrons whirl closer and closer to you as though they were guards keeping you from leaving. It is difficult to guide the Seeker in this maze of atoms. The instruments are useless now. The figures of the Atlanteans disappers. Suddenly, you are caught in the elastic membrane that almost stopped you before. It sticks to the Seeker, holding you back. You want to be free and return to the world youhave known all your life.\nYou lose consciousness and wke up severalhours later in your sea suit floating above the hold in the ocean floor. The Seeker is gone. You're dazed: did you dream the whole thing? SLowly you return to the surface, but the Maray has disappeard. You can't decide how much time has elapsed. You realize that your crew must think you are lost forever and you know they are right. The waves rock your unresisting body back and forth as you float alone in the vast sea. You feel your strength slowly draining away. THE END

Part.9b /*pg 96*/ A thought traveler! You realize that people do it all the time in day dreams. Of course, you want to be a thought traveler, but how?\nThe Atlanteans speak softly and tell you that all things are the same-past, present, future are all the same. It simply requires you to concentrate and put your thoughts where you wish them to be.\nYou try, and amazingly you are rapidly rushed through time to the day you were born, then to the day you made your first deep-sea dive. Your mind flies from one time in your life to another. But when it comes to the future, you meet a blank wall. You can't seem to travel into the future.\n"Why can't I travel ahead in time," you ask the Atlanteans.\n"Be patient," they replay. "All in good time."\nSuddenly you whirl through time into the outer reaches of the universe where you can actually reel the light going through you. You cast no shadow. A sense of peace fills you.
Choice.9b.10a Drop out of thought travel and return to earth life. /*pg 110*/
Choice.9b.10b THE END

Part.9c /*pg 90*/ "I will go with you. I want to see other parts of the universe."\n"Congratulations. You will not regret this. We are ready to depart."\nThey take you to a small room and three of them stand with you under a beam of intense light. You feel a rush of speed, and yet you are not moving. You feel as though you have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles in space. You rush past the sun, past and through the Milky Way, and on into other galaxies. Yet, you feel as though you are still standing in the same spot.\nThen you are on the planet Aygr where the Atlanteans came from. It is a world of fantastic shapes and strange plants. The city gleams like a thousand search lights. The shapes that must be their buildings are pure light pulsing with energy. Nothing is hard or sharp. Everything is light. You see no people, just forms of brighter light that move. Suddenly, some of the moving forms change into Atlanteans.\"Our bodies are not important. It is our energy that is important. You can see us in our body forms if you wish, but we only use them to communicate with people like you. You may choose to remain as you are or accept transformation."
Choice.9c.10b Stay in your body form. /*pg 101*/
Choice.9c.10c Be transformed into an energy shape. /*pg 102*/

Part.10a /*pg 110*/ Over 110 years of thought travel later, you are called into the main thinking room. You are told that you may now return to earth life. You have doubts about going back, but you are curious to see what changes have occurred while you were living in Atlantis.\nWhat a sight greets you as you circle earth at an altitude of 1000 feet! The great cities of the world, New Your, London, Paris, and Hong Kong are overgown with vegetation. The roads leading into the cities are barely visible. But you see signs of new settlements. There are clusters of buildings spread out in the countryside. You don't see any smokestacks. There are few roads and no cars. The people live a simple life providing themselves with food, shelter, and clothing. You wish to join them. THE END

Part.10b /*pg 101*/ You just can't give up your body. It might be all right for the Atlanteans to move about as pure energy, but you have not reached a point where you are willing to risk what you are for what they are.\nIt is strange wandering about with bright glowing blobs of energy moving with you. They ask you to give talks about life on earth as you know it, and you agree. For two years you meet with the Atlanteans in the energy forms and talk about earth and how people live and what they do. The Atlanteans are interested in all aspects of earth life: the technology, politics, wars, and religion.\nYou ask them why, but they never give you a direct answer. Then one day you look down at yourself and you only see bright, glowing energy. With horror you realize you have become one of them. THE END

Part.10c /*pg 102*/ You are in the Atlantean world; why not become like an Atlantean? Looking down at your hands, you see them gradually begin to glow with a warm, yellow light. Little by little, the glow travels up your arms and legs until suddenly you have no body left. You are a glowing energy form. You feel a sense of freedom and happiness that you have never known before. You can float, or fly, or zoom anywhere you want to. No walls stop you; you just melt through them. You don't need food or rest. You can travel through time, and you can travel instantly back to earth in your energy form.\nYou feel that this is the way you want to be. THE END
